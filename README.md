From-scratch implementations of core Machine Learning algorithms with mathematical foundations.
# Machine Learning from Scratch - Beginner-Friendly Projects

Welcome to **Machine Learning from Scratch**, a collection of fundamental ML algorithms implemented **from scratch using Python and NumPy**.  
This repository is designed for beginners who want to **understand the core concepts behind ML algorithms** without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn.

Each project is self-contained in its own folder with:
- Clear, commented Python code
- Step-by-step implementation

## 📚 Included Projects

### Regression
- **Linear Regression** – Predict continuous variables with gradient descent.
- **Polynomial Regression** – Extend linear regression to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Logistic Regression** – Binary classification using the sigmoid function.

### Classification
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Classify data points based on closest neighbors.
- **Decision Tree** – Build decision trees from scratch for classification.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier** – Simple probabilistic classifier for text or categorical data.
- **Perceptron** – Basic neural network unit for understanding supervised learning.

### Clustering
- **K-Means Clustering** – Partition data into K clusters using iterative refinement.
